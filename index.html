    <h2>Exercise 1 - Word Cloud</h2>

    <p id="myParagraph">
      The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate
      existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same
      vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
      pronunciation, and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new
      common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive
      translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform
      grammar, pronunciation, and more common words. If several languages
      coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is simpler and more
      regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language
      will be simpler and more regular than the existing European languages. It
      will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an
      English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical
      Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is.
